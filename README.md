This Story Viewer project is a simple web-based application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that mimics the story feature seen on social media platforms like Instagram and WhatsApp. The interface consists of a card-like structure where users can horizontally scroll through circular story thumbnails. When a user clicks on a story, it opens in full-screen mode and automatically disappears after three seconds. The project dynamically renders stories from an array of objects containing display pictures and corresponding full-screen images. JavaScript is used to generate the story elements, handle click events, and control the timing for the full-screen view. The design is clean and responsive, featuring smooth transitions and an intuitive user experience.
